The unofficial channel is for informal conversation, including memes. \n  \nLanguage - There are generally no profanity filters in the server; however, if you excessively cuss out someone even if they ask you to stop, you are breaking the overarching principle. \n  \nSexual content - Media that contains sexually inappropriate content will not be allowed in the server. Please keep in mind that it is in fact illegal for minors to view sexually explicit content without parental/guardian consent in the United States, and it is therefore also illegal to distribute sexually explicit content to minors. Just follow the law, and you will be fine. \n  \nGore - Any content that shows real gore will not be allowed in the chats.
